What is it?

Meerkat, named for its pop up like behavior, is a jQuery plugin created by Jarod Taylor. 

It was originally created to serve a specific purpose, however, by adding additional 
functionality to it, I've found several uses for it.

Whether it's used as a simple promotional tool, a roost for advertisements, or 
even as an alternative to a splash or entry page; Meerkat is unobtrusive, cross-browser 
compatible, and degrades gracefully if Javascript has been disabled.

Installation
------------

 1. Extract the compressed download
 
 2. Upload the directory to your site's modules directory.
    (Don't know where to put it? sites/all/modules is a good choice.)
    
 3. Go to Admin -> Site Building -> Modules and activate the Meerkat and Meerkat Node
    
Configuration
-------------
    
 1. Go to Admin -> Settings -> Meerkat and configure any admin settings

 2. Go to Admin -> Settings -> Meerkat -> Defaults -> Add and create some meerkat defaults to use
 
 3. Go to Admin -> Settings -> Meerkat Node and select which content types you would like to have 
 meerkat functionality.
 
 4. When creating a node, there will be a Meerkat fieldset to enter the meerkat content, input format, and defaults to use.
 
 5. (Optional) Customize the css style for the meerkat container.
